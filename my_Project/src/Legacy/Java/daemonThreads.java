/*
 * Daemon Threads:
 * LOW Priority Thread in Java, performs tasks ----> Garbage Collection
 *      Also, known as Service Provider Threads , provides servie to User Threads for background supporting tasks.
 * 
 * 
 * Its life depends upon mercy of user Threads. i.e. when user Thread will die 
 *           JVM terminates its automatically.
 *           
 *           
 *>> By default, the main thread is always non-daemon.
 *>> For remaining threads, Daemon nature will inherited from Parent to child.
 *>> Whenever last daemon threads terminates then all daemon threads terminates.
 *
 *METHODS:
 *a. void setDaemon(boolean on)       ---> Marks current thread as Daemon Thread or User Thread
 *
 *  on: if true, marks this thread as a daemon thread
 *  
 *b. boolean isDaemon()               ---> Checks that current thread is Daemon Thread or not.
