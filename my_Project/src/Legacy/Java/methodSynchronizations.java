 * >> Synchronization is needed when multiple object is Mutable.
 * 
 * >> If object is shared by multiple threads then there is need of synchronization
 *     to avoid the Object's state to be getting corrupted.

 *     i.e. Each thread will receive same state of Object, without get changed by another thread 
 *

 *     Methods Synchronization
 *     Statement(s) Synchronization(Block Synchronization)
